<h2> Description</h2>
This is me practicing HTML, CSS and some Javascript creating a band for one of my favourite bands: Manel. 
Since I come from the movie/video world, I really like to have things "moving" so I tried to create some elements around that concept. 
That way I could practice working with animations and keyframes on CSS.
